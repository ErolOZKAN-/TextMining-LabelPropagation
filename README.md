# TextMining-LabelPropagation
In this assignment we try to implement a semi-supervised, transductive learning approach which assumes that each data point can be linearly reconstructed from its neighborhood. We propagate the labels from the labeled points to the whole dataset using their neighborhoods. We test our code on a small dataset as well as on the suplied Reuters dataset.
